%{bin:X} and %{bin-available:X} lookups are narrowed to the packages declared
immediately in the (depends ...) field. Transitive and unrelated package
binaries are not implicitly exposed.


  $ make_lockdir

A lockdir package [transitive] that installs [transitive-bin]:

  $ make_lockpkg transitive <<'EOF'
  > (version 0.0.1)
  > (build
  >  (progn
  >   (system "\| cat > transitive-bin <<'EOI'
  >           "\| #!/usr/bin/env bash
  >           "\| echo from transitive
  >           "\| EOI
  >   )
  >   (system "chmod +x transitive-bin")
  >   (system "echo 'bin: [ \"transitive-bin\" ]' > transitive.install")
  >  ))
  > EOF

A lockdir package [direct] that depends on [transitive] and installs [direct-bin]:

  $ make_lockpkg direct <<'EOF'
  > (version 0.0.1)
  > (depends transitive)
  > (build
  >  (progn
  >   (system "\| cat > direct-bin <<'EOI'
  >           "\| #!/usr/bin/env bash
  >           "\| echo from direct
  >           "\| EOI
  >   )
  >   (system "chmod +x direct-bin")
  >   (system "echo 'bin: [ \"direct-bin\" ]' > direct.install")
  >  ))
  > EOF

A sibling lockdir package [other] that installs [other-bin], not depended on
by [direct]:

  $ make_lockpkg other <<'EOF'
  > (version 0.0.1)
  > (build
  >  (progn
  >   (system "\| cat > other-bin <<'EOI'
  >           "\| #!/usr/bin/env bash
  >           "\| echo from other
  >           "\| EOI
  >   )
  >   (system "chmod +x other-bin")
  >   (system "echo 'bin: [ \"other-bin\" ]' > other.install")
  >  ))
  > EOF

The project's package depends only on [direct] (with a [dir] field so
narrowing kicks in):

  $ make_dune_project 3.25
  $ cat >> dune-project << 'EOF'
  > (package
  >   (allow_empty)
  >   (name my-pkg)
  >   (dir .)
  >   (depends direct))
  > EOF

  $ cat >dune <<'EOF'
  > (rule
  >  (action
  >    (with-stdout-to path-output (bash "echo $PATH"))))
  > (rule
  >  (with-stdout-to direct-out (echo %{bin-available:direct-bin})))
  > (rule
  >  (with-stdout-to transitive-out (echo %{bin-available:transitive-bin})))
  > (rule
  >  (with-stdout-to other-out (echo %{bin-available:other-bin})))
  > EOF

  $ dune build @all

[direct-bin] (direct dep) is available:

  $ cat _build/default/direct-out
  true

[transitive-bin] is not implicitly available:

  $ cat _build/default/transitive-out
  false

[other-bin] (an undeclared package) is not available:

  $ cat _build/default/other-out
  false

The directly declared provider and its build prerequisite were built:

  $ dune trace cat | jq 'select(.cat == "process" and .name == "finish" and .args.target_dirs[]?) | .args.target_dirs[]' | sort -u | censor
  "_build/_default+lockfile/pkg/direct/.opam/direct/target"
  "_build/_default+lockfile/pkg/transitive/.opam/transitive/target"

Only its bin directory is added to $PATH:

  $ env_added "$(cat _build/default/path-output)" "$PATH" | censor
  $PWD/_build/_default+lockfile/pkg/direct/.opam/direct/target/bin

Capability narrowing does not remove the transitive build ordering retained by
the direct provider target. It does avoid pulling in an unrelated package:

  $ dune clean
  $ dune build direct-out
  $ if test -f "$(get_build_pkg_dir other)/target/cookie"
  >  then echo "other *was* built"; else echo "other was not built"; fi
  other was not built

[transitive] is built as a prerequisite of [direct], without exposing its
capabilities to the workspace package:

  $ if test -f "$(get_build_pkg_dir transitive)/target/cookie"
  >  then echo "transitive *was* built"; else echo "transitive was not built"; fi
  transitive *was* built
