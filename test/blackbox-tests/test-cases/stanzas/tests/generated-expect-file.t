Demonstrate that we are not allowed to generate the expected file by another rule:

  $ cat >dune-project <<EOF
  > (lang dune 3.18)
  > EOF

  $ cat >dune <<EOF
  > (rule (write-file foo.expected "foo bar"))
  > (test
  >  (name foo))
  > EOF

  $ cat >foo.ml <<EOF
  > print_endline "baz";;
  > EOF

  $ dune runtest
  File "dune", line 3, characters 7-10:
  3 |  (name foo))
             ^^^
  Error: File "foo.expected" cannot be generated by another rule, it must be a
  source file.
