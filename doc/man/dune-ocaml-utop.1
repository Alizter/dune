NAME
       dune-ocaml-utop - Load library in utop

SYNOPSIS
       dune ocaml utop [OPTION]… [DIR] [ARGS]…

DESCRIPTION
       dune utop DIR build and run utop toplevel with libraries defined in
       DIR

OPTIONS
       --action-stderr-on-success=VAL
           Same as --action-stdout-on-success but for the standard output for
           error messages. A good default for large mono-repositories is
           --action-stdout-on-success=swallow
           --action-stderr-on-success=must-be-empty. This ensures that a
           successful build has a "clean" empty output.

       --action-stdout-on-success=VAL
           Specify how to deal with the standard output of actions when they
           succeed. Possible values are: print to just print it to Dune's
           output, swallow to completely ignore it and must-be-empty to
           enforce that the action printed nothing. With must-be-empty, Dune
           will consider that the action failed if it printed something to
           its standard output. The default is print.

       --build-info
           Show build information.

       --context=CONTEXT (absent=default)
           Select context where to build/run utop.

       --error-reporting=VAL (absent=deterministic)
           Controls when the build errors are reported. early - report errors
           as soon as they are discovered. deterministic - report errors at
           the end of the build in a deterministic order. twice - report each
           error twice: once as soon as the error is discovered and then
           again at the end of the build, in a deterministic order.

       -f, --force
           Force actions associated to aliases to be re-executed even if
           their dependencies haven't changed.

       --file-watcher=VAL (absent=automatic)
           Mechanism to detect changes in the source. Automatic to make dune
           run an external program to detect changes. Manual to notify dune
           that files have changed manually."

       --passive-watch-mode
           Similar to [--watch], but only start a build when instructed
           externally by an RPC.

       --react-to-insignificant-changes
           react to insignificant file system changes; this is only useful
           for benchmarking dune

       --sandbox=VAL (absent DUNE_SANDBOX env)
           Sandboxing mode to use by default. Some actions require a certain
           sandboxing mode, so they will ignore this setting. The allowed
           values are: none, symlink, copy, hardlink.

       -w, --watch
           Instead of terminating build after completion, wait continuously
           for file changes.

       --wait-for-filesystem-clock
           Dune digest file contents for better incrementally. These digests
           are themselves cached. In some cases, Dune needs to drop some
           digest cache entries in order for things to be reliable. This
           option makes Dune wait for the file system clock to advance so
           that it doesn't need to drop anything. You should probably not
           care about this option; it is mostly useful for Dune developers to
           make Dune tests of the digest cache more reproducible.

COMMON OPTIONS
       These options are common to all commands.

       --always-show-command-line
           Always show the full command lines of programs executed by dune

       --auto-promote
           Automatically promote files. This is similar to running dune
           promote after the build.

       --build-dir=FILE (absent DUNE_BUILD_DIR env)
           Specified build directory. _build if unspecified

       --cache=VAL (absent DUNE_CACHE env)
           Enable or disable Dune cache (either enabled or disabled). Default
           is `disabled'.

       --cache-check-probability=VAL (absent DUNE_CACHE_CHECK_PROBABILITY
       env)
           Check build reproducibility by re-executing randomly chosen rules
           and comparing their results with those stored in Dune cache. Note:
           by increasing the probability of such checks you slow down the
           build. The default probability is zero, i.e. no rules are checked.

       --cache-storage-mode=VAL (absent DUNE_CACHE_STORAGE_MODE env)
           Dune cache storage mode (one of auto, hardlink or copy). Default
           is `auto'.

       --config-file=FILE
           Load this configuration file instead of the default one.

       --debug-artifact-substitution
           Print debugging info about artifact substitution

       --debug-backtraces
           Always print exception backtraces.

       --debug-cache=VAL
           Show debug messages on cache misses for the given cache layers.
           Value is a comma-separated list of cache layer names. All
           available cache layers: shared,workspace-local,fs.

       --debug-dependency-path
           In case of error, print the dependency path from the targets on
           the command line to the rule that failed. 

       --debug-digests
           Explain why Dune decides to re-digest some files

       --debug-findlib
           Debug the findlib sub-system.

       --debug-load-dir
           Print debugging info about directory loading

       --debug-store-digest-preimage
           Store digest preimage for all computed digests, so that it's
           possible to reverse them later, for debugging. The digests are
           stored in the shared cache (see --cache flag) as values, even if
           cache is otherwise disabled. This should be used only for
           debugging, since it's slow and it litters the shared cache.

       --default-target=TARGET (absent=@@default)
           Set the default target that when none is specified to dune build.

       --diff-command=VAL (absent DUNE_DIFF_COMMAND env)
           Shell command to use to diff files. Use - to disable printing the
           diff.

       --disable-promotion (absent DUNE_DISABLE_PROMOTION env)
           Disable all promotion rules

       --display=MODE
           Control the display mode of Dune. See dune-config(5) for more
           details.

       --dump-memo-graph=FILE
           Dumps the dependency graph to a file after the build is complete

       --dump-memo-graph-format=FORMAT (absent=gexf)
           File format to be used when dumping dependency graph

       --dump-memo-graph-with-timing
           With --dump-memo-graph, will re-run each cached node in the Memo
           graph after building and include the runtime in the output. Since
           all nodes contain a cached value, this will measure just the
           runtime of each node

       --help[=FMT] (default=auto)
           Show this help in format FMT. The value FMT must be one of auto,
           pager, groff or plain. With auto, the format is pager or plain
           whenever the TERM env var is dumb or undefined.

       --ignore-promoted-rules
           Ignore rules with (mode promote), except ones with (only ...). The
           variable %{ignoring_promoted_rules} in dune files reflects whether
           this option was passed or not.

       --instrument-with=BACKENDS (absent DUNE_INSTRUMENT_WITH env)
           "Enable instrumentation by BACKENDS. BACKENDS is a comma-separated
           list of library names, each one of which must declare an
           instrumentation backend.

       -j JOBS
           Run no more than JOBS commands simultaneously.

       --no-buffer
           Do not buffer the output of commands executed by dune. By default
           dune buffers the output of subcommands, in order to prevent
           interleaving when multiple commands are executed in parallel.
           However, this can be an issue when debugging long running tests.
           With --no-buffer, commands have direct access to the terminal.
           Note that as a result their output won't be captured in the log
           file. You should use this option in conjunction with -j 1, to
           avoid interleaving. Additionally you should use --verbose as well,
           to make sure that commands are printed before they are being
           executed.

       --no-config
           Do not load the configuration file

       --no-print-directory
           Suppress "Entering directory" messages

       --only-packages=PACKAGES
           Ignore stanzas referring to a package that is not in PACKAGES.
           PACKAGES is a comma-separated list of package names. Note that
           this has the same effect as deleting the relevant stanzas from
           dune files. It is mostly meant for releases. During development,
           it is likely that what you want instead is to build a particular
           <package>.install target.

       -p PACKAGES, --for-release-of-packages=PACKAGES (required)
           Shorthand for --release --only-packages PACKAGE. You must use this
           option in your <package>.opam files, in order to build only what's
           necessary when your project contains multiple packages as well as
           getting reproducible builds.

       --print-metrics
           Print out various performance metrics after every build

       --profile=VAL (absent DUNE_PROFILE env)
           Select the build profile, for instance dev or release. The default
           is dev.

       --promote-install-files[=VAL] (default=true)
           Promote the generated <package>.install files to the source tree

       --release
           Put dune into a reproducible release mode. This is in fact a
           shorthand for --root . --ignore-promoted-rules --no-config
           --profile release --always-show-command-line
           --promote-install-files --default-target @install
           --require-dune-project-file. You should use this option for
           release builds. For instance, you must use this option in your
           <package>.opam files. Except if you already use -p, as -p implies
           this option.

       --require-dune-project-file[=VAL] (default=true)
           Fail if a dune-project file is missing.

       --root=DIR
           Use this directory as workspace root instead of guessing it. Note
           that this option doesn't change the interpretation of targets
           given on the command line. It is only intended for scripts.

       --store-orig-source-dir (absent DUNE_STORE_ORIG_SOURCE_DIR env)
           Store original source location in dune-package metadata

       --terminal-persistence=MODE
           Changes how the log of build results are displayed to the console
           between rebuilds while in --watch mode. Supported modes: preserve,
           clear-on-rebuild, clear-on-rebuild-and-flush-history.

       --trace-file=FILE
           Output trace data in catapult format (compatible with
           chrome://tracing)

       --verbose
           Same as --display verbose

       --version
           Show version information.

       --workspace=FILE (absent DUNE_WORKSPACE env)
           Use this specific workspace file instead of looking it up.

       -x VAL
           Cross-compile using this toolchain.
